### I'm Cancheng Li :cn: !

- :wink::mortar_board: **I am a second-year PhD student in cognitive neuroscience working with Dr. [Julie Golomb](https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/) in [Vision and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/) at The Ohio State University.** Also, I am the **OSU EEGlab manager**ÔºÅ

     I graduated with a MSci degree in **cognitive neuroscience** from **East China Normal University** (Shanghai, China) in 2021. Also, I was a member of [**Memory and Emotion Lab**](https://sysumelab.com) led by **Dr. Yixuan Ku** in **Sun Yat-sen University** (Guangzhou, China) and a research assistant in **Peng Cheng National Laboratory** (Shenzhen, China).
     
     Before that, I received a BEng degree in **software engineering** from **Northeastern University** (Shenyang, China) in 2018.
- :eyes::key: I‚Äôm currently working on visual perception, especially visual stability and 3D perception, by using behavior, EEG, fMRI and computational models.
- :sweat_smile::high_brightness: I‚Äôm the author of [NeuroRA](https://zitonglu1996.github.io/NeuroRA/) and [PyCTRSA](https://github.com/ZitongLu1996/PyCTRSA) - Two Python toolboxes for representational analysis.
- :yum:::notebook_with_decorative_cover: I'm also the author of [the first Chinese Python EEG data analysis handbook](https://github.com/ZitongLu1996/Python-EEG-Handbook).
- :e-mail::mailbox_with_mail: If you have any question about my projects, you can email me: [zitonglu1996@gmail.com](zitonglu1996@gmail.com) / [lu.2637@osu.edu](lu.2637@osu.edu)
- :smiley::bulb: Research Interests: Object/Face Perception, Visual working memory, Mental imagery, Attention, Emotion, Machine Learning & Deep Learning.
- :wink::ghost: Current Focused Topics: :one: Visual stability - How to trigger spatiotopic representations in behavior? & How do our brains integrate object locations from retinotopic coordinates to spatiotopic coordinates? :two: 3D perception - How our brains represent depth information and 3D integration in space (using fMRI) and time (using EEG)?
- :dizzy_face::telescope: Future Goals: :one: Explore how brain encodes visual information (basic visual features, locations, objects, facial expressions/identities) in visual perception, visual memory and mental imagery. :two: Explore the similar or different representations and connections between biological brain and AI models. :three: How emotion and reward influences different cognitive processes and how our brain represents emotion and reward. :four: Using neuroscience methhods to improve cognitive ability.
